## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.warning


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars,warning=TRUE}
##Trying to put in a warning - Couldnt get to work
summary(cars)
summary(cars$dist) 
Summary(cars$speed)
summary(pressure)
##Couldnt get a third summary to go
```

fig.heiht, fig.width


## Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure,warning=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
